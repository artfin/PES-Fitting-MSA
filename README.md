# PIP-NN PES

This is a software designed to fit potential energy surfaces using neural network optimization routines. The fitting routine is built upon the invariant polynomials generated by MSA software.

### Scripts
* `genpip.py`  -- invokes MSA library to generate PIP basis in the form of dynamic library `.so`
* `make_dataset.py` -- prepares an array of the values of the invariant polynomials in the provided configurations
* `train_model.py`   -- trains a MLP model based on a YAML configuration file [see `models` directory] 

### Pipeline

* train model using `train.py` script
* plot errors using `eval_model.py` script
* export model to TorchScript using `export_model.py` script 

### Creating working environment

`python3 -m venv pytorch`
`source pytorch/bin/activate'
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
