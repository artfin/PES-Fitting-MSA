# PIP-NN PES

This is a software designed to fit potential energy surfaces using neural network optimization routines. The fitting routine is build upon the invariant polynomials generated by MSA software.

### Scripts
* `genpip.py` -- invokes MSA library to generate PIP basis in the form of dynamic library `.so`
