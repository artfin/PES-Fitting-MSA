# PIP-NN PES

This is a software designed to fit potential energy surfaces using neural network optimization routines. The fitting routine is built upon the invariant polynomials generated by MSA software.

### Scripts
* `genpip.py`  -- invokes MSA library to generate PIP basis in the form of dynamic library `.so`
* `dataset.py` -- prepares an array of the values of the invariant polynomials in the provided configurations
* `lsqfit.py`  -- generates a Fortran program that performs least-squares regression on the Dataset values [calls dgells/LAPACK routine]
* `train.py`   -- [work in progress] trains an MLP model to the dataset and utilizes Optuna library to optimize the neural network architecture
